## Distributed and Concurrent Programming project 2
This repository contains the second project for Distributed and Concurrent Programming course @Unibo
- src/main/java/exercise1 contains a simple concurrent & async physics simulator in which a pool of n bodies moves respecting the constraints given by the repelling force and friction
- src/main/java/exercise2 contains a simple async java project analyzer API based on JavaParser & Vert.x (https://javaparser.org/ & https://vertx.io/)
- src/main/java/exercise3  contains a simple reactive java project analyzer API based on JavaParser & JavaRX (https://javaparser.org/ & https://reactivex.io/)
